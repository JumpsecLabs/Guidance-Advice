	# Purpose: This script was written in response to the discovery that the SAM file had a permissions error that allows any user to read it's contents. This facilitates privilege escalation and as such, we quickly put this script together to help the community quickly determine how widespread their internal attack surface was for this.

#Ensure errors don't ruin anything for us
$ErrorActionPreference = "SilentlyContinue"

#Print basic script info
Write-host "`nThis script will collect OS info and determine if the SAM, SECURITY, SYSTEM files can be read by any user due to permissions error`n"
write-host -foregroundcolor Magenta "`nRunning Script.......`n"

###collect computer information###
	# Funnily enough, this takes the longest 
	
#Variables for OS version
$Name = ([System.Net.Dns]::GetHostByName(($env:computerName))).Hostname
$OS = (gin).OsName
$Ver = (gin).WindowsVersion
$Build= (gin).OSBuildNumber

#demarcate OS Info section
Write-host "`n---OS Info---"

#print variables for OS version. Stupid formatting here to get the colours because I am extra
Write-host -foregroundcolor Magenta "`n$Name " -NoNewline
write-host "is running " -NoNewline 
write-host -foregroundcolor Magenta "$OS " -NoNewline
write-host "version number " -NoNewline
write-host -foregroundcolor Magenta "$Ver " -NoNewline
write-host "and build number "  -NoNewline
write-host -foregroundcolor Magenta "$Build`n"

###Determine if SAM is vulnerable###

#demarcate results section
write-host "`n---Vulnerability Results---"

##for loop to collect permissions for SAM, SECURITY, and SYSTEM. Likely overkill, as the permissions for one are likely the permissions for all.
$items = @("SAM", "SECURITY", "SYSTEM")
foreach ($item in $items) {
	$ErrorActionPreference = "SilentlyContinue" ;
if ((get-acl C:\windows\system32\config\$item).Access |
	? IdentityReference -match 'BUILTIN\\Users' | 
	select -expandproperty filesystemrights | 
	select-string 'Read')
	{write-host -foregroundcolor Red "`n$Name may be vulnerable: Arbitrary Read permissions for $item file`n"}
else {
	write-host  -foregroundcolor Green "`n$Name does not seem to be vulnerable, $item permissions are fine`n"}
}
#The logic here is basic on filtering the permissions for the SAM, security, and system files until we get the permissions string. The permissions string we alert as 'vuln' for is 'Read'.
	# If the script cannot access the permissions, if the script gets a different permission string, it will return as 'not vuln', which should be accurate but of course explore this further.
